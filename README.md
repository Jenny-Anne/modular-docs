## Modular Documentation Template Files

Another deliverable for this project is the module templates for the various module types.
All the module template files for writing new modular content can be found here:

## What is the Purpose of the Modular Documentation Project?

To provide documentation teams with a set of resources to assist them as they write user-driven content or convert their current documentation framework to a modular-based documentation framework.

## Why Are We Doing This?

To help the documentation teams become more agile with their documentation. This agility will help us to better serve our readers with a more purposeful reading experience. A modular-based content model sets a foundation for innovation. Modular documentation provides a structure for writing and presenting user-story-based documentation. User-story-based documentation attempts to address the reader's needs more than focusing on feature-based documentation. User-story-based documentation also helps the documentation teams with the amount of documents that they have to maintain, by helping them to focus on what really matters.

## Building the Books Locally

When you make changes to these books, it is a good practice to do a local test build to verify the book builds successfully and renders as you expect before you submit the merge request back to upstream master.

### Configuring the Build Environment

You can build the book locally using [AsciiDoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/#get-started-with-asciidoctor).

### Building the Modular Documentation Reference Guide

To build and view the document locally, run:

```
$ asciidoctor modular-docs-manual/master.adoc
$ <www-browser-of-choice> modular-docs-manual/master.html
```
