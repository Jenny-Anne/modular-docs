= Text snippets

A text snippet is a section of text that is stored in an AsciiDoc file. Text snippets contain content that is reused in multiple modules or assemblies.

NOTE: A text snippet is not a module. It cannot include structural elements of a module such as an anchor ID or an H1 heading.

.Examples of snippets:
* One or more paragraphs of text
* A step or series of steps in a procedure
* A table or list
* A note, for example a disclaimer for technology preview or beta releases
