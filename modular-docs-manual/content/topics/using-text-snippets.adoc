= Text Snippets

A text snippet is a small section of text that is stored in an AsciiDoc file. Text snippets contain content that is resused in multiple modules or assemblies, for example:

* A step or series of steps in a procedure
* A disclaimer, for example, for technology preview or beta releases

NOTE: A text snippet is not a module.

.Procedure

+
NOTE: Consider storing snippet files in a separate snippets folder.

. Add a variable to the snippet files that identifies its content type:
+
[source]
----
:_content-type: SNIPPET
----

. Add an `include::` statement to the file that you want to add the snippet to, for example:
+
[source]
----
include::snippets/beta-note.adoc
----
