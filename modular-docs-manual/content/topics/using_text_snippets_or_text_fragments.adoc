= Text Snippets or Text Fragments (Pseudo-modules)


[NOTE]
The following standard is recommended when the documentation is being maintained without a Content Management System (CMS) capable of managing complex interrelations between modules.

The use of reusable text snippet files (or text fragment files) is discouraged due to the complications that can arise due to the complexity they introduce.

Snippet (fragment) file use should be limited to:

* Standardized admonitions (such as 'Technology preview' and 'Beta' text).
* Where there is an existing standard between the upstream and downstream communities.
