// Retains the context of the parent assembly if this assembly is nested within another assembly.

ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly-my-user-story.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly-my-user-story_{context}"]
// * Title: = My user story

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken. Include {context} in the ID so the assembly can be reused:
[id="assembly-my-user-story_{context}"]
= My user story
//If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring.
:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

[role="_abstract"]
This paragraph is the assembly introduction. It explains what the user will accomplish by working through the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. The `[role="_abstract"]` tag defines the first paragraph of the introduction for search metadata.

.Prerequisites
//Prerequisites are optional. Delete if your assembly has no prerequisites.

* X is installed. For information about installing X, see <link>.
* You can log in to X with administrator privileges.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other assemblies.

include::modules/TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_explaining_a_concept.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// [leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module title is a level 1 heading (= Title), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Title) in the assembly. Use [leveloffset=+2] and [leveloffset=+3] to nest modules in an assembly.

include::modules/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_reference-material.adoc[leveloffset=2]

[role="_additional-resources"]
== Additional resources (or Next steps)
// An optional bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the assembly.
