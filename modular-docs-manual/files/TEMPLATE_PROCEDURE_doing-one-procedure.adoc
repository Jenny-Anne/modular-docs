// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc-doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id="doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="proc-doing-one-procedure_{context}"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Doing one procedure
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.
